# Things that would be nice to have in Nx publishable library schematic

## Easy
- disable ivy
- better readme template
- license

## Hard
- most of the other stuff ngneat/lib does :)

- some form of release system
  - commitizen to facilitate useful commit messages
  - something to generate change logs with commits
  - possibly nx-semantic-release
